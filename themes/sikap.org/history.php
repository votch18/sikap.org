                 	<p>
						Sibog Katawhan Alang Sa Paglambo (SIKAP), Inc. was born in 2006 out of genuine aspiration of its founding partners for transformative and genuinely sustainable community development work. The professed aspiration was borne out of founding partners’ first-hand knowledge of and actual experiences working with vulnerable communities as the latter demonstrated their desire for respectable and improved quality of living.

						SIKAP’s founding partners had individual knowledge, insights, and aspirations gained from years of experiences living and working in various social settings. Cognizant of the potentials that lie beneath these diverse backgrounds and disciplines, SIKAP’s founding partners decided to work together to pursue causes that inspire people and strengthen communities.  It was at this juncture that a partnership was forged between SIKAP’s founding partners and World Neighbors-Philippines, an international Non-Government Organization that had project implementation in Agusan del Sur at that time.  Such a partnership paved the way for the implementation of community capacity-building program that was focused on natural resource management and healthcare and livelihood enhancement. Needles to say, the partnership opened the door for myriad of opportunities for SIKAP’s founding partners to realize their common aspiration.

					<p>
On April 10, 2007, SIKAP formally took off, following the acquisition of its Certificate of Registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a non-stock, non-profit organization. Prior to SIKAP’s SEC registration, the Board of Directors and management staff of the organization conducted series of meetings and workshops to formulate the organization’s strategic direction and operational framework. 
					</p>
					<p>
Over the years, SIKAP has gradually strengthened its capacity and effectiveness as a committed community development advocate and facilitator. It has gained the respect of multi-sectoral partners and has become a recognized active player in the arena of community development and/or empowerment.
