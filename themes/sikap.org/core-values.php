					<br/>
					<h4><b>Integrity</b></h4>

						We connect and relate with our partners and other stakeholders with honesty, integrity, and openness. We adhere to transparency and accountability as important tenets in all that we do.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h4><b>Pro-Active</b></h4>
					<p>
						We look for ways to innovate and respond to challenges with dynamism and anticipation in order to always be a part of the solution rather than the problem. Our actions strengthen and build relationships with our partners and different stakeholders.

						We continually learn new skills, introduce strategies and approaches with a clear view of looking at reality and cultural differences.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h4><b>Self-Reliance</b></h4>
					<p>
						We have strong commitment to help ourselves by continuously seeking and spotting opportunities and enhancing our capacities as a learning organization. 						
					</p>
					<br/>
					<h4><b>Compassion</b></h4>
					<p>
