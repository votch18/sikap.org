						To achieve SIKAP’s Vision and Mission, the following major strategies are pursued:
					</p>				
					<ol>
						<li><b>Quality Program Diversification</b>
							<br/>
							<p>
								<img src="/filemanager/ABOUT_US/sikap_approach.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: auto; max-width: 500px; " align="right"/>
								SIKAP expands and diversifies into integrated/holistic, environment-oriented, gender-sensitive, innovative, responsive, sustainable and high-impact programs and projects.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Strengthening Linkages and Partnerships</b>
							<br/>
							<p>							
								SIKAP strengthens existing partnerships, alliances and linkages, and expands network building in technical resources, educational and civic institutions, national and international funding agencies, other non-government and government agencies. This ensures that human, financial and other relevant expertise and knowledge in these institutions will be put to good use in SIKAP’s development work.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Pursue Quality Systems and Procedures</b>
							<br/>
							<p>							
								SIKAP develops quality systems to become effective and efficient. These include administrative systems and policies, human resource management systems and policies, management information systems, management planning and communication systems, and programs/projects performance information, monitoring and evaluation systems, all of which must be enhanced and improved.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Enhancement of Employee’s Professional and Technical capabilities</b>
							<br/>
							<p>							
								SIKAP is staffed with professional and technical employees to maintain an efficient program/project management track record. This can be done by having a well-defined motivational and incentive system which will provide training and workshops that will enhance professional capabilities, and encourage formal and non-formal studies. Personnel hiring shall be done judiciously such that those hired will match the professional needs of the organization.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Financial Sustainability</b>
							<br/>
							<p>							
								SIKAP develops innovative strategies in generating funds to finance programs and projects to attain its mission. It has to diversify fund sources (local, national and international) and improve its internal income generating capacity such as establishing social credit program, conducting training and consultancies.
