					<br/>				
					<p>
						SIKAP’s Approach/Key Strategy is Community-Driven Participatory Development), an approach in which people are given the opportunity to take greater responsibility for and leadership in the development and protection of their community, with concerned local and national government agencies and civil society organizations providing facilitative support services. In the implementation of SIKAP’s strategy, one activity begets another in a logical flow and the process is as important as the result.
